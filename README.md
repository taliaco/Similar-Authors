In this project I designed a recommendation system for similar authors based on information held in Linked Data, the recommendation is made based on the books subjects written by authors. 
It's a complex query that was not possible in today's system, since it requires the construction of an additional layer containing a list of subjects and their weight in the database for any author. In the original system, you cannot immediately retrieve information about subjects the author holds, but only on the books themselves.

In the project I combined practices from three different fields:

Recommendation system systems are a useful alternative to searching algorithms since they help users discover items they might have missed. Interestingly enough, recommendation system are often implemented in search engines using  indexing non-traditional data.

MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging) standards are a set of digital formats that describe items catalogued by libraries such as books, movies, pictures and etc.  

Linked Data is about using the Web to connect related data from different sources. By applying Linked Data principles, data published on the web in machine readable format which allows connecting it to other related data already available on the web. By making data more understandable and available, Linked Data approach offers significant advantages over current practices used for publishing library data.
